Search Algorithm Task:

## Person 1:

Create a program that generates a list containing N unique integers from 0 - 500. N varies based on user input. The list cannot contain duplicates of any integer, and the integers should be randomly arranged.

## Person 2:

Create a program that sorts the list of integers created by person 1. The list should be in order from smallest to largest.

## Person 3:

Create a program that can search the list and return true if an integer is present and false if the requested integer is not present.
